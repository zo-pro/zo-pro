# CoAI MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the CoAI platform - a decentralized AI collaboration network built on Solana. The MVP will focus on establishing the core functionality to demonstrate the platform's value proposition while maintaining a feasible development scope.

## Core Principles

1. **First Principles Approach**: Focus on building the essential components that demonstrate the unique value proposition of CoAI.
2. **End-to-End Functionality**: Ensure a complete user journey from registration to task completion and payment.
3. **Blockchain Integration**: Leverage Solana for key functionalities requiring decentralization and transparency.
4. **Hybrid Intelligence**: Implement basic AI-human collaboration features to showcase the platform's potential.
5. **Incremental Development**: Build the system in stages with clear milestones and functionality checkpoints.
